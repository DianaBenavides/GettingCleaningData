The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, collects data from experiments with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Here, we provide a tidy dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, along with the R Code for obtaining it from the original data.
